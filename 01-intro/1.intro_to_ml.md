## Intro to ML

Machine learning is introduced in the context of its' business importance. The example given in this lecture corresponds to an user trying to sell his car in a website. 

What price should he post so that 1) The price is not too high and no one would be interested in buying it 2) The user does not leave any money at the table (A potential buyer could have been willing to pay more than the user posted). 

Machine learning could help users price the car better by learning the relationship between features and prices of cars in the current database. Some features: age, manufacturer, mileage, etc...

Typically, you could get your car priced by an expert whose experience let him learn patterns between features of a car and its' price. But this can be done by a model as well.

## Model Training

In a nutshell, there are two data types: features and target. We train the model with these and encapsulate the patterns found in a file (this is the model itself).

*Predictions*

Once we have our model, we can use it to predict the target value of a new car given its' features.
