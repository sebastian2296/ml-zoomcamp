## What are the differences between Rule Based Systems and ML?

This concept is introduced through the example of a spam filter. A rule based system
would require the developer to hardcode the patterns he considers to be present in a spam containing email. Two shortcomings of this approach: spam emails changing over time and the maintability issues that arise from the former (hardcode a new rule each time the developer identifies it).

On the other hand, ML focuses on identifying patterns from spam emails whose recipients marked them as spam. We train our model with this information and the next time we process a new spam email (without label) we can classify it based off of its' features (that could as well be the features that were hardcoded by the developer in the RBS).

**Note**: it is recommedend to start with RBS and then use these rules as (encoded) features in a ML model.

Once we obtain our model, we can use it to predict whether a new email is spam or not. These predictions are probabilities and to be classified as spam or not it'll be necessary to define a threshold.
