## What is supervised ML?

Models in which we give the model a label corresponding to a set (combination/pattern) of features.
With this examples,the model tries to generalize and generate labels for new data.

When give a model the target values, we essentially are telling it what's the outcome we want to get; the model will process the data to generate this expected output.

We organize this features and labels in a matrix. Each row is an observation and each column represents a measure of it. We denote the features matrix as *X* and the label vector as *y*.

The objective is to train a model so that it gets as close as possible to the target variable. 
The output of this function for classification problems, the output is a probability (a price in regression).

## Different types of Supervised ML 

**Regression**: outcome is continous

- The objective is to predict a value for a particular instance based on its' features.

**Classification**: outcome is a binary category 

- The objective is to classify an observation based on its' characteristics (spam example).

**Multi class**: Outcome is a category within a specified list of possible outcomes

- Given some features, the task is to predict which category of the potential outcome corresponds to the observation.

**Ranking**: Orders a set of items based on a score determined by the model
